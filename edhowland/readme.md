# Ed Howland's solutions to Bart's PBS Challenges

Wonder why this file is named: readme.md and not README.md

## The Challenges

- pbs-148-bash-potpourri/
  * Reads a list of menu items and asks user for their choices and then prints them
- pbs-149-getopts
  * Continuing with pbs-148, improve the code with option parsing using getopts


... And hopefully many more!
