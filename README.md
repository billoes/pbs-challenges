# pbs-challenges
This is a place for learners to share their code with other learners.

Rules:

1. Use your folder to keep your own code. Don't modify anyone else's files in their own folders
2. Please try to use the naming convention of your own folders as leading with `pbsxxx-`. e.g. `pbs146-shell-loops`. This will help others to find your code for a particular challenge.
3. Play nice.
