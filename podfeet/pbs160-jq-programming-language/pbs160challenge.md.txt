# Optional Challenge
Develop a more advanced searching script that expects three variables:

1. search â€” a search string to check the laureate names against case-insensitively
2. minYear â€” an earliest year a matching prize can have been awarded in.
3. maxYear â€” a latest year a matching prize can have been awarded in.

For bonus credit, can you make both year arguments effectively optional?



# Search script to find earliest year a matching prize can have been awarded 
# Input JSON Nobel.json
# Output: all prizes awarded on or after a given year and on or before another year
# Variables: minYear, maxYear
