# This script was written as a response to the challenge posted by
# Bart Busschots in Programming By Stealth 151 at https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs151
# My solution is a reuse of code from PBS146 where we learned Shell Loops
# The challenge was written as:
	# Write a script to render multiplication tables in a nicely formatted table. Your script should:
	# Require one argument â€” the number to render the table for
	# Default to multiplying the number given by 1 to 10 inclusive
	# Accept the following two optional arguments:
	  # -m to specify a minimum value, replacing the default of 1
	  # -M to specify a maximum value, replacing the default of 10
	# For bonus credit, pipe the output through less if and only if standard out is a terminal.
	
	# ```
	# 1 x 3 = 3
	# 2 x 3 = 6
	# 3 x 3 = 9
	# 4 x 3 = 12
	# 5 x 3 = 15
	# 6 x 3 = 18
	# 7 x 3 = 21
	# 8 x 3 = 24
	# 9 x 3 = 27
	# 10 x 3 = 30
	# ```
	
	# For bonus credit, update your script to allow the user to specify how high the table should go, defaulting to 10 like above.

# My solution goes a bit beyond and allows the user to define the specific range, not just 1-x

# Set default inputs
number=5
rangemin=1
rangemax=10

# Define the usage string on bad input
usage="Usage: $(basename $0) [-n NUMBER] [-m MINIMUM] [-M MAXIMUM]"

# Define a regular expression for a whole number to check each value against
# Optional + or - sign followed by one or more digits from 0 to 9
# This allows whole positive or negative numbers
regex=^[+-]?[0-9]+$

# I'll do error checking, n, m and M are optional flags
while getopts ':n:m:M:' opt
do
	case $opt in
		n) 
			# The number to be multiplied
			number="$OPTARG"
			;;
		m) 
			# Minimum value to use as multiplier
			rangemin="$OPTARG"
			;;
		M) 
			# Maximum value to use as multiplier
			rangemax="$OPTARG"
			;;
    ?)
      # here comes my fancy error message if they type something after the shell
      # script name that isn't -n, -m, -M
      echo "$usage"
      exit 1
      ;;
	esac
done



# Check to see if they put in a bigger min than max, and count down instead if so
# --- Change to use printf ---
rowFormat="%4d %2s %2d %2s %'4d\n"
if [[ $rangemin -le $rangemax ]]
	then
			while  [[ $rangemin -le $rangemax ]]
			do 
			# use `bc` basic calculator to do the arithmetic
				answer=`echo "$rangemin*$number" | bc`
				# echo "$rangemin x $number = $answer"

				# Goal to print 5 columns: multiply-by, x, multiplier, =, answer
				# 1,3,5 are digits so %d
				# 2, 4 are strings so %s
				# rough cut let them be right justified
				printf "$rowFormat" "$rangemin" x "$number" = "$answer"
				# printf '%20d\n' "$rangemin"

				((rangemin=rangemin+1))
			done
	else
		while  [[ $rangemin -ge $rangemax ]]
			do
				# use `bc` basic calculator to do the arithmetic
				answer=`echo "$rangemin*$number" | bc`
				# echo "$rangemin x $number = $answer"	
				printf "$rowFormat" "$rangemin" x "$number" = "$answer"
				# decrement rangemin to count down
				((rangemin=rangemin-1))
			done
