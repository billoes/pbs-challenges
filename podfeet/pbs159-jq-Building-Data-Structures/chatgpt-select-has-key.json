I can help you with skipping dictionaries in an array that donâ€™t have a specific key using jq. ðŸ˜Š

One possible jq query that can do this is:

.[] | select(has("key"))

This query filters the array by selecting only the elements that have a given key. For example, if you have an array like this:

JSON

[
  {"name": "Alice", "age": 25},
  {"name": "Bob"},
  {"name": "Charlie", "age": 30}
]
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
And you want to skip the dictionaries that donâ€™t have the age key, you can write:

.[] | select(has("age"))

This query will output:

JSON

{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
{"name": "Charlie", "age": 30}
