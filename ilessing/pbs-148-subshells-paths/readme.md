In the meantime, if you want some more Bash practice, update your solution to the challenge to accept an optional argument limiting the number of items a user can order from the breakfast menu.

### To Dos

- [ ] use `$BASH_SOURCE` environment variable
- [ ] use `dirname` and `basename` functions to derive correct paths
- [ ] allow running the main script from some other directory
- [ ] accept an argument
- [ ] if agument is numeric treat it as item limit
